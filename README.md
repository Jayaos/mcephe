### Learning Medical Concept Embeddings
We use [GloVe](https://nlp.stanford.edu/pubs/glove.pdf) and [node2vec](https://snap.stanford.edu/node2vec/) for learning medical concept embeddings.

#### Learning Medical Concept Embedding using GloVe
1. Install Python 3.5.2 and all packages in the requirements.txt.
2. Prepare dataset. GloVe takes a list of patient visits, where each visit of a patient contains multiple medical concepts, as an input. For example, [["concept A", "concept B"], ["Concept A", "Concept C", "Concept D"], ...]. No need to deliminate different patients since GloVe calculates co-occurrence based on a single visit. Concepts do not need to be encoded as integer. The GloVe package automatically encodes all existing unique codes in the training data and will output a mapping dictionary between concepts and corresponding integer codes (concept2id).
3. Start training by using GloVe.py in /src. 

#### Learning Medical Concept Embedding using node2vec
1. Install Python 3.5.2 and clone the [node2vec repository](https://github.com/aditya-grover/node2vec).
2. Prepare dataset. node2vec takes a list of relationships between concepts as an input. Two concepts in a relationship must be deliminated by a space and different relationships must be deliminated by a linebreak like the following:

       <"concept_id_1"> <"concept_id_2">
       <"concept_id_1"> <"concept_id_3">

An example input format is provided at the node2vec repository. Note that if relationships have a direction, order of concepts must be aligned according to the direction. Concepts are required to be encoded as integers.

3. Start training by using node2vec package:

       python main.py --input <"path of input data"> --output <"path to save results">

Detailed instruction is provided at the node2vec repository.


### Evaluating Learned Medical Concept Embeddings
We evaluate learned embeddings based on the phenotypes from [PheKB](https://www.phekb.org/). Condition (i.e. diagnosis) concepts included in 33 phenotypes were provided in /data/concepts_phenotypes.pkl as a pickle file. All concepts were converted to [OMOP CDM](https://www.ohdsi.org/data-standardization/the-common-data-model/). 

1. Prepare learned MCEs to be evaluated.
2. Prepare a json file that contains settings. This json file should include information about the locations of MCEs, directories, and hyperparameters. An example format of the json file is provided at /data.
3. Start evaluating by using evaluation.py.
